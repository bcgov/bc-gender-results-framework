## About

The Gender Results Framework represents the Government of Canada’s vision for gender equality, highlighting the key issues that matter most.  Under this framework, the federal government has identified six key areas where change is required to advance gender equality. [More information is available](https://women-gender-equality.canada.ca/en/gender-results-framework.html) on the Government of Canada's website.

This shiny app is a proof of concept to support access to available B.C. data for the Gender Results Framework indicators.
